# My CV

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages)

A Markdown / Jekyll / Bootstrap project to make me look employable and exciting.

## Resources used to build this.

* [Bootstrap 4 GitHub pages](https://nicolas-van.github.io/bootstrap-4-github-pages/)
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

## Why did I use Bootstrap 4 GitHub pages??

Simply put - it works and it was nice and easy. It gets out of the road so that I can work on the content of the page.

Reasons it rules:

* A full Bootstrap 4 theme usable both on Github Pages and with a standalone Jekyll.
* Recompiles Bootstrap from SCSS files, which allows to customize Bootstrap's variables and use Bootstrap themes.
* Full support of Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins.
* Supports all features of Github Pages and Jekyll.
